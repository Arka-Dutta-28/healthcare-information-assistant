Podiatry,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/podiatry/faqs,Can Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) affect my lower limbs?,"Individuals who are suffering from PAD face a higher risk of heart attack, stroke and death. If undetected, PAD can lead to amputations of lower limbs, thereby increasing the chances of having a heart attack. We perform a non-invasive ankle brachial index (ABI) test to determine if you are at a risk of developing PAD or already have it. The ABI index compares the ankle blood pressure against arm blood pressure to determine the progression of the disease. However, many individuals with PAD do not experience leg symptoms like cramping, pain or fatigue. The common symptoms you can witness are: • Tiredness, pain in the legs, buttocks that always happens when you walk but goes away when you rest. • Foot or toe pain that often disturbs your sleep • Skin wounds or ulcers on your feet or toes that are slow to heal"

They are majorly benign in nature but can be infectious if not treated properly. They have a tendency to spread through skin to skin contact. However, not all strains of this virus are contagious because it depends on the person’s immune system. Genital warts which are transmitted sexually lead to unwanted skin growths. These skin growths can cause pain, discomfort and itching. These are dangerous for women as some types can eventually cause cancer around vaginal area if not treated properly."

Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,What should I carry for my first appointment?,"Consultation with an oncologist may be a stressful or fearful experience. Your head may be buzzing with a host of fears, worries and questions. The first step is making an appointment with an oncologist — a doctor who specializes in treating cancer. If this is your first clinic visit, you should plan to arrive ½ to 1 hour prior to your appointment so you can register and complete formalities. You can ask for all concerned specialists one after the other. Learn about the pre consultation process, time taken so that you can schedule accordingly. The first thing the oncologist will ask about is your medical history. When you get into the doctor’s office, it’s very easy to forget when things happened, so it’s helpful to write down your history to remember the timeline of events. Keep notes about your symptoms and what made you go to your doctor in the first place. What tests did your doctor order? Were you referred to additional specialists? Have you previously been treated for cancer? In order to make it a thorough consultation, the oncologist you’re meeting with should have all your reports and other requested materials. This includes copies of scans, x-rays, MRIs, CTs, or other imaging tests that were done, and pathology slides and blocks if a biopsy was performed. It is always advisable to file them properly. Some hospitals have the practice of making their files. Please allow them to do so. More than you can imagine, a lot depends on how well you and your cancer specialist communicate. And talk is a 2 way street. It’s not just telling the doctor what’s wrong and him/her giving you statistics. It’s also your listening to them and the doctor listening to you. You have very little time to develop a good working relationship with your doctor. From day one, your preparation will help establish good communication that will carry through all stages of diagnosis, treatment and recovery. So it’s a good idea to be upfront with your doctor and let him/her know about your other medical conditions, previous surgeries, other cancers and treatment, prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, and herbal supplements. Don’t assume “it’s all there in the record.” Make a list and bring it with you. You may not realize it, but how well you’re handling your diabetes may impact on how well your chemotherapy works on your breast cancer or how well your radiation works on your prostate cancer. • Bring a list of any drugs you’re taking, both prescription and over-the-counter. Be sure to include vitamins, minerals, and supplements. • Organize copies of your information in a loose-leaf binder with pockets. It will become a handy reference kit. Include a written list of questions about your diagnosis and treatment options."
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,How should I test for Cancer?,"It is advisable to go for regular medical check-ups rather than waiting for symptoms or pain to occur. It is not correct to jump to conclusions as only a doctor has the qualification to tell the patient whether it is cancer or any other condition. Apart from the physical examination, he may conduct a series of tests and imaging procedures. If the initial tests do not reveal any mutations, the doctor will advise a biopsy that removes a sample of tissue that is then diagnosed by a pathologist. A pathologist is able to judge what kind of cancer cells have manifested and their likely chances of growth. When to visit the doctor? • Fever higher than 100.5°F • Cough or sore throat • Vomiting that continues for longer than 12 hours • Severe constipation or diarrhoea • Bleeding or bruising • Shortness of breath/chest pain • Urinary burning • Blood in the urine or stool • Pain in a new place or pain that is not relieved by your pain medicine"
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,Is cancer a communicable disease?,Cancer is not a contagious disease. It does not spread from one person to another. A healthy person cannot get it from a cancer patient by close contact or breathing the same air. The only time when cancer has the possibility to spread is when there is a transplantation of tissue or organ. We know that germs like bacteria and virus are communicable with any form of physical contact. This leads to the misconception that cancers are contagious. It is worth knowing that the cancer cells from an infected person are thoroughly destroyed by the cells of a healthy person. This is so because the immune system of a healthy person is very strong whereas that of a cancer stricken patient is quite weak. The immune system of the patient further takes a great deal of beating during the entire process of treatment.
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,Can I safely interact with children and others at home?,You may worry that these lifesaving treatments could somehow be harmful to your loved ones. The general answer to this concern is that physical contact is fine with children and other members at home.

Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,Does cancer thrives on sugar?,"The Internet is awash with claims that sugar feeds cancer growth and that eliminating sugar from your diet will cure the disease. However, there is no conclusive evidence that proves eating sugar will make cancer grow and spread more quickly. All cells in the body, both healthy cells and cancer cells, depend on glucose, a type of sugar, to function. And the body breaks down all of the food you eat into glucose molecules. So, eating sugar won’t speed up the growth of cancer, just as cutting sugar out completely won’t slow down its growth. This doesn’t mean you should eat a high-sugar diet, though. Consuming too many calories from sugary foods has been linked to weight gain, obesity, and diabetes, which increase the risk of developing cancer and other health problems."
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,"If no one in my family has had cancer, does that mean I’m risk-free?","No. Based on the most recent data, about 40 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lives. Most cancers are caused by genetic changes that occur throughout a person’s lifetime as a natural result of aging and exposure to environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke and radiation. Other factors, such as what kind of food you eat, how much you eat, and whether you exercise, may also influence your risk of developing cancer."
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,Am I too old for cancer treatment?,"There is no age limit for cancer treatment. Decisions about cancer treatment for older adults should take into consideration the same factors as for younger adults and should not focus on the person’s age alone. Many older patients benefit as much as younger patients from treatment. However, some older adults may have other illnesses that limit the use of specific treatments."
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,Can cancer surgery or a tumor biopsy cause cancer to spread in the body?,"The chance that surgery will cause cancer to spread to other parts of the body is extremely low. Following standard procedures, surgeons use special methods and take many steps to prevent cancer cells from spreading during biopsies or surgery to remove tumors. For example, if they must remove tissue from more than one area of the body, they use different surgical tools for each area."
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,What do I need to know about my risk of developing a new cancer?,"The risk that your cancer returns, or recurs, depends on the type of cancer you had, the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the treatment you received, how much time has passed since your treatment, genetic factors, and environmental exposure. Your doctor can discuss your personal risk of recurrence with you. The signs and symptoms of recurrence vary based on the type of cancer and how it has grown. In some cases, you may not feel or see any signs. Therefore, it’s vitally important to attend follow-up visits with your doctor or nurse to monitor your health. Tell your healthcare provider about any new symptoms you have so that they can be evaluated. However, at the same time, remember that every symptom you have will not be related to cancer."

Usually the end of treatment brings pivotal changes, both mental and physical, for cancer survivors, including a recommended switch back to a mostly diet rich in unsaturated fats to manage weight. Just like other healthy people, cancer survivors should consume a diet of fruits and vegetables, grains and protein. Regular exercise which is not strenuous especially during chemotherapy has the following benefits • Increases Appetite • Allays Depression • Decreases chances of constipation And of course helps in checking the weight and aggravation of Diabetes and cardiovascular related diseases The important thing is to keep Doing Exercise to a level which does not let fatigue set in and therefore these schedules should not be stringent."
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,What are the other methods if the disease restricts intake of food?,People who can’t eat on their own but whose bodies can digest food might get “tube feedings.” People who get tube feedings get their food and nutrients through a tube that goes into the stomach or small intestine. This is also called Enteral feeding.
Cancer,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer/faqs,Are there herbal products that can cure cancer?,"No. Although some studies suggest that alternative or complementary therapies, including some herbs, may help patients cope with the side effects of cancer treatment, no herbal products have been shown to be effective for treating cancer. In fact, some herbal products may be harmful when taken during chemotherapy or radiation therapy because they may interfere with how these treatments work.

The treatment for this can be done through colonoscopy itself or surgical intervention may be needed if the cancer in the polyp is high grade. • Stage 2 cancer – This is the stage where the cancer has grown beyond the colon wall and into nearby tissues but not the lymph nodes. The best treatment in this stage is surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. • Stage 3 Cancer – This is the stage where the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes apart from the colon wall. The best treatment would be surgery to remove the affected area along with the lymph nodes followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may be an option available for people who aren’t fit for surgery. • Stage 4 Cancer – This is the stage where the cancer has spread to distant organ and tissues.

This fact provides an interesting clue to the link between diabetes and obesity. Understanding what causes the disease will hopefully allow us to prevent diabetes in the future. Being overweight places extra stress on your body in a variety of ways, including your body’s ability to maintain proper blood glucose levels. In fact, being overweight can cause your body to become resistant to insulin. If you already have diabetes, this means you will need to take even more insulin to get sugar into your cells. And if you don’t have diabetes, the prolonged effects of the insulin resistance can eventually cause you to develop the disease. The good news is type 2 diabetes is largely preventable. Research studies have found that lifestyle changes and small amounts of weight loss in the range of 5-10% can prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes among high-risk adults. Lifestyle interventions including diet and moderate-intensity physical activity (such as walking for 150 minutes per week) were used in these research studies to produce small amounts of weight loss. The development of diabetes was reduced 40% to 60% during these studies that lasted 3 to 6 years. Preventing weight gain, increasing activity levels and working toward small amounts of weight loss if you are overweight can have a big impact on the likelihood that you will develop diabetes in the future. Managing your weight is the best thing you can do to prevent the development of diabetes."

Neurosciences,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/neurosciences/faqs,"""What causes slipped disc? Are there any treatment options available?""","As you get older, your spinal discs start to lose their water content, making them less flexible and more likely to rupture. A slipped disc occurs when the outer case of the disc splits, resulting in the gel inside to bulge out of the disc. The damaged disc can put pressure on the whole spinal cord or on a single nerve. A slipped disc can cause pain both in the area of the protruding disc and in the area of the body controlled by the nerve that the disc is pressing on. Smoking also plays a role as it causes the discs to lose their natural flexibility. There are a number of factors that can put increased pressure and strain on your spine. These include: • bending awkwardly • Jobs that involve heavy or awkward lifting • Jobs that involve lots of sitting, particularly driving • being overweight or obese • Weight bearing sports, such as weightlifting • A traumatic injury to your back, such as a fall or accident Situations such as these can weaken the disc tissue and can sometimes lead to a slipped disc. An initial treatment will usually involve a combination of physiotherapy and medication to relieve the pain. Though in some severe cases like if the pain continues for more than 6 weeks, surgery may also be recommended to release the compressed nerve and remove a part of slipped disc."

Kidney Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/kidney-transplant/faqs,How is a possible living donor evaluated?,"Many variables are considered when evaluating a possible living donor. Living donors must be over 18 years of age, healthy, free of kidney disease and have normal blood pressure. The best matches come from full siblings (brothers or sisters). Areas of evaluation include the following. • Blood group (A, B, O) compatibility of donor and recipient. • Tissue typing: Once the donor’s blood group matches with the patient’s blood group, tissue typing is advised. Both the recipient and donors blood is tested HLA – A, B, & DR. Generally, 50% match is accepted. For spouse donor, even lower match is acceptable. • We have got an experience of performing ABO incompatible kidney transplant. Even if blood group of donor & recipients are not matching, then also transplant can be done. In modern era with the availability of plasmapheresis, adsorption filters and few special drugs, it can be made possible with comparable results."

As a result insulin production from the pancreas stops. It is seen most commonly in young children and was previously known as juvenile diabetes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin resistance is a condition in which the cells do not respond normally to insulin. Insulin resistance results in decreased absorption of glucose into the cells. Insulin resistance in combination with a partial deficiency of insulin secretion from pancreas is believed to be responsible for development of type 2 diabetes.

Eye Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/eye-care/faqs,What is the laser surgery of cataract?,"Phacoemulsification Surgery is done through 2.2 mm self-sealing incision. The cloudy lens is broken into small pieces and sucked out by an ultrasonic high speed vibrating handpiece. After the Cataract material is removed, the back capsule of the lens is left behind on which a clear foldable intraocular lens is implanted. The bladeless Femto technique offers laser assisted cataract surgery to make it blade free.

Eye Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/eye-care/faqs,How do you treat lazy eye (Amblyopia) in children?,"The earlier the treatment, the better the opportunity to reverse the vision Loss. Although the best outcome is achieved if treatment is started before age 5, research has shown that children older than age 10 can show improvement in the affected eye. Before treating Amblyopia, it may be necessary to first treat the underlying cause. Glasses are commonly prescribed to improve focusing or misalignment of the eyes. Squint Surgery may be performed on the eye muscles to straighten the eyes if non-surgical means are unsuccessful. Eye exercises may be recommended either before or after surgery to correct faulty visual habits associated with strabismus and to teach comfortable use of the Eyes. The correction may be followed by:  Patching or covering one eye for a period of time ranging from a few weeks to as long as a year. The better-seeing eye is patched, forcing the ""Lazy"" one to work, thereby strengthening its vision.  One should also be wary of over-patching or over-penalizing the good eye when treating for Amblyopia, as this can create so-called ""Reverse Amblyopia"" in the other Eye.  Medication- in the form of Eye Drops or Ointment—May be used to blur the Vision of the good eye in order to force the weaker one to work. This is generally a less successful approach. The treatment for Amblyopia requires lot of effort and patience from both the doctors and parents. Both have to work as a team to achieve the desired results."
Eye Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/eye-care/faqs,How many hours of patching is enough to treat Amblyopia?,"The mainstay of treating Amblyopia is patching of the dominant (good) Eye, either full or part-time during waking hours. The performance of near activities (Reading, Coloring, hand-held computer games) during treatment may be more stimulating to the brain and produce better or more rapid recovery of vision."
Eye Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/eye-care/faqs,What are the treatment options available for squint?,"It is the common name for “strabismus” where the eyes are not aligned in the same direction.

Eye Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/eye-care/faqs,What tests are done to diagnose Glaucoma?,"Routine eye examination includes- • Applanation Tonometry-to measure intraocular pressure • Fundus- documents the changes of Optic Nerve head(disc) while looking at your fundus through pupil • Gonioscopy- The type of Glaucoma is detected by assessing the angle of an interior chamber of Eye by gonioscopy. Depending on the level of suspicion, we ask for following confirmatory test: • Perimetry - computerized visual field test to detect areas of fading vision. • Central corneal thickness-to refine the results of our eye pressure measurements • Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)-anatomical documentation of the optic nerve head and nerve fibre layer"
Eye Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/eye-care/faqs,"I have Refractive Error, what should I opt for Spectacles, contact lens or Lasik?","The option of any of above depends on the age, Refractive Error, Eye Condition and Personal Choice. • Age- Contact Lens and Lasik is not an option for children. They should wear spectacles. Teenagers can use Contact Lens while the minimum age limit for Lasik is 18 years. • Contact lens is a safe option if a person does not want to wear glasses. • If Contact Lens do not suit you or find it cumbersome to handle them, Lasik is a good option. It gives you a permanent solution to get rid of your Glasses or Contact Lens. Only the reading or near number may come up later in life after 40 to 45 years of age.

Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,What is the procedure of dental implants? How long do they last?,"Dental implants are tapered cylindrical posts of titanium, which are placed in the jaw by the implantologist. They are substitutes for tooth roots that might stimulate the jaw bone and prevent its disintegration after the removal of the natural tooth. The area is allowed to heal for a few months, when the implant will fuse itself to the bone. Thereafter, a small connector is placed on the jaw on which the replacement tooth will be placed. The experts say that the dental implants last for about 40 years."
Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,Who are the right candidates for dental implants?,"Dental implants are placed in adults.

Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,Is there a procedure to change the shape of my teeth?,"A smile makeover often includes reshaping of the teeth for a more youthful appearance. Small details such as tooth size and shape have a great impact on the smile of a person. Teeth may be lengthened or shortened, broadened or narrowed. Various modes of treatment can be employed to achieve these. A buildup of the tooth/teeth can be done using composite or veneers. Gum reduction may be done to achieve the appearance of increased length of the teeth. Dental bonding may be done to fill gaps between teeth, repair small chips, and smoothen rough edges. It is called as a bonding because the tooth colored resin material is bonded to the tooth using adhesives and a high intensity curing light. The shade matching with the rest of the teeth is important because it gives a natural look rather than the appearance of white teeth. Dental crowns are tooth-shaped ""caps"" placed over teeth. Crowns are usually made of porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal, and restore the tooth's natural shape, contour, and appearance. They form the entire visible portion of the tooth. Veneers are wafer-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials, either porcelain or resin, that are bonded to the front surface of teeth. Recontouring or reshaping removes small amounts of tooth surface to change a tooth's size, shape, surface or length. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages and differ in terms of cost, durability, and ""chair time."""
Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,"""If I have been diagnosed with diabetes, am I prone to dental diseases?""","People with poorly controlled diabetes are prone to dental diseases. Due to reduced blood supply, gum diseases are more common, causing deterioration of the jaw bone faster. The mouth is dry with plaque accumulation, resulting in gum diseases and tooth decay. Patients should be wary of bleeding gums, sores in the mouth, bad breath and tooth decay. With proper control of diabetes, and regular dental checkups, optimum oral health can be maintained.

Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,Do you give a smile makeover? What is the procedure?,"A smile makeover can be achieved in various ways, depending on what the patient requires. These include a. Tooth colour: Despite having perfectly aligned teeth, stains and discolouration often cause distraction. Your dentist can perform in-office bleaching or teeth whitening, and he/she can pick out a shade of colour, which best matches, your skin complexion. Tooth color and shade is an important consideration for a smile makeover procedure such as porcelain veneers, dental crowns, and composite bonding. b.

Alignment: Severely misaligned smiles are best treated by orthodontics, keeping in mind the best treatment results, and health of the teeth. When a smile is severely misaligned, the course of treatment is to re-align all the teeth. Minor misalignments can be treated with composite restorations or veneers, but these need to be done with caution."

Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,Is there a procedure to replace multiple teeth?,"There are three options for replacing multiple teeth: a. Dentures: They are false teeth that are relatively quick and easy to fabricate. These are removable. They can be partial, to replace one or a few missing teeth, or complete, to replace all the teeth in a mouth where they are missing. A denture is a metal or acrylic framework which supports the false teeth. The framework is removable, and is designed to fit around the adjacent teeth. b. A Bridge uses the natural teeth which lie adjacent to the area of the missing tooth, to support the false tooth/teeth between them. The natural teeth need to be shaped or contoured, in order to fit the bridge over them. A bridge is usually of 3 units, which means that for the replacement of one missing tooth, two of the adjacent teeth will be shaped to hold the bridge. c. Dental implants are also used to replace natural teeth and are now the preferred line of treatment. Implants are usually composed of two major parts: the implant, which is cylindrical, tapered and titanium posts placed in the jaw to support the crown; and the crown, which is the tooth part visible in the mouth. Implants are excellent options as they look, feel, and function just as natural teeth do."
Dental Care,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/dental-care/faqs,What are the pre-surgery and post-surgery instructions?,"Pre-operative instructions include: • Eating well a few hours before the procedure. • Plan to eat soft foods for a few days after the procedure • Wear loose, comfortable clothing to your appointment.

Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,What is the difference between allogenic and autologous bone marrow transplant?,"An interesting observation here is that the type of bone marrow used for transplant is different from the different types of BMT: 1. Allogenic BMT: Donor and Recipient are two separate individuals and BMT is done using the stem cells of donor. It may be: 1.1 Matched Related, where donor is HLA matched relative usually a sibling. 1.2 Matched Unrelated, where donor is not a relative of patient and usually found from one of the various national or international registries. 1.3 Partially Matched Related, where donor is from a patient’s family but partially matched (haploidentocal). 2. Autologous BMT: Donor and Recipient are same individuals. BMT is done using the patient’s own stem cells. The procedure involves giving high dose chemotherapy to patient in order to remove primary disease. Thereafter, an autologous transplant is conducted to rescue damaged bone marrow. This type of transplant has minimal complication and is preferred for diseases like multiple myeloma."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Am I at a higher risk of getting infections from an unrelated bone marrow transplant?,"Generally, the risks are reduced if: • you are young – studies have shown the younger you are, the more likely the treatment is to succeed • you receive stem cell donation from a sibling (brother or sister) • you have no serious health conditions (apart from the condition you're being treated for)"
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Is there any risk to the donor?,"It is an extremely safe procedure for the donor and the patient can return to normalcy within 6 months- 1year post successful transplant. The modern day advancements are such that the risk to donor is nearly negligible. However, they may get fever and or body pain for 1 day or so whichever is manageable. The donor need not be admitted and does not require anesthesia."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Is BMT similar to a kidney transplant?,"No, Bone Marrow Transplant is a medical procedure. Mostly, stem cells are collected via peripheral vein and the whole procedure is like donating blood or platelet. In some patients Bone marrow harvest is done which involves general anesthesia to the donor."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Will I be able to resume work after treatment?,An ideal situation for the donor should be to stay near transplant center for a week or so after transplant as patient may require platelet support from his donor.
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,What are post-treatment precautions?,"Post transplant, the patient should avoid crowded places and eat hygienic food. In case you tend to witness the symptoms of GVHD like diarrhea, skin rashes, and jaundice, consult the doctor immediately."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,What happens if there is no donor available?,These days we can do unrelated donor search from international bone marrow donor registries. There are already several patients who have been benefitted from transplants with bone marrow or stem cells being donated at international centers and brought to India.
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Why is the procedure costly?,"Bone marrow transplant involves giving high dose chemotherapy to the patient. Donor also receives some injections called growth called growth factors. Stem Cell collection requires apheresis which requires a dedicated blood bank support. However, the most part of BMT is management of post-transplant drop in blood counts which may require high grade antibiotics and antifungals. Therefore, BMT is usually done in HEPA filtered rooms to reduce incidence of infections."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Will I ever be able to lead a normal life?,"Yes, patient can return to his normal routine in 6 months – 1 year post successful transplant. However, he needs to follow up with transplant centre as advised."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Are there any complications?,"You can experience: • Graft versus host disease- Is a life threatening condition that can develop after stem cell transplant. GVHD occurs the new cells are not able to recognize the organs and tissues of recipient’s body. It may cause a skin rash, itching, liver or gastro intestinal system (loose stool or pain abdomen). • Bacterial Infections that can cause a permanent organ damage • Respiratory problems -Causes inflammation of the airway and serious problems of the pulmonary system. • Low blood cells and low platelets, which can cause excessive bleeding in the brain, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. There can be complications from the conditioning regimen after transplant when bone marrow is severely depleted. To prevent these complications, patient needs to be monitored in special HEPA filter rooms."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,Do I require continuous follow-ups?,"It depends upon the disease and type of transplant whether autologous or allogenic. In case of autologous transplant, patient needs to follow up for around 1-2 months, whereas in Allogenic transplant at least 3 months follow up is necessary. In case patient develops any complications a longer follow up is required."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,What if my patient does not have a matched sibling?,"If the patient does not have a matched sibling, the other options available are matched unrelated donor and partially matched sibling donor transplant. However, cost can significantly go up in matched unrelated donor transplant because of costs involved in procuring stem cells. Partially matched transplant is another option but it involves increased risk of GvHD and infections."
Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/bone-marrow-transplant/faqs,What is the success rate?,"Success of bone marrow transplant usually depends on stage of disease, duration of disease and patient's condition at the time of transplantation. With modern day medicines and technological advances one expects a cure rate of 90% if BMT is performed at age of 3 years for thalassemia while it drops to 80% if done at the age of 7 years."
